# DiscordPredicted
This simple program generates CSVs and (ugly) graphs showing your predicted age and gender over time according to Discord analytics.

Here's an example graph:

# How to use
1. Download [DiscordPredicted.exe](https://github.com/ElectricSpace25/DiscordPredicted/releases/download/release/DiscordPredicted.exe) and place it in an empty folder
2. Find the required json file in your Discord data package under activity > analytics (the file name will start with "events")
3. Rename the json file to "data.json" and place it in the same folder as DiscordPredicted.exe
4. Run the exe - it will generate your CSVs and graphs in the same folder
